# GodotVisualBasic    
VisualBasic through C# for Godot4.   
i found several examples for F# through C# but not for VisualStudio (searched with google and in the forum)    
So i tried to get it to work, heres the first test.     
like F# you can use another language without GDExtension!    


# HowTo:    
0. use this exampleproject for start or:    
1. create with Godot4* mono a new project (mono cause we use C#) for example a node2d    
2. add a C#-script
3. open VisualStudio, add a new VisualStudioProject to projectmap (select in the same directory, select .NET 6.0)
4. in the first project add the VisualStudioProject as reference
5. in the VisualStudioProject add in the references to the packets the packet GodotSharp
